# Colourant Mapping Project

The Colourant Mapping Project is a web application written with django framework and is the last project for the course CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science (HarvardX).

The Colourant Mapping Project aims to systematically record the occurrences of ancient pigments, dyes, and other painting materials, through a bottom-up approach. Our ambitious vision is to create an open-access database of ancient colourants that can be used by researchers and the wider public to illustrate patterns of exchange and highlight regional variations. The project relies on the contributions of its users, who can submit new entries through the designated form. Each entry will be reviewed to avoid duplicates and ensure the academic integrity of the database. Our map will be updated and new entries will be included shortly after your submissions.
