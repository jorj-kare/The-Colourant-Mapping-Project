        Ariadne Marketou is a chemist with a PhD in archaeology. Her research
        interests include ancient colours and colour-perception, archaeological
        science and chemical analysis. The idea for the Colourant Mapping
        Project emerged from the challenges that Ariadne faced when she was
        conducting research on the pigments of Mediterranean antiquity.

        George Karellakis is the web developer behind this webpage, who found
        the way to tackle the problem of Colourant Mapping as part of the course
        CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science (HarvardX).
